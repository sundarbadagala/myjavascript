//Generators helps to suspend the function execution
//it simplifies the creation of iteration

//By generators we can get multiple outupus
// -> if you take normal function, it gives only one value when we return that value
// -> but in generators we can get multiple ouputs by using yield
// -> by this we are not only getting multiple values, and also we can susupend execution the function, until next call

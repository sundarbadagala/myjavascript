//a factory function is simply a function that returns an object without using the keyword new so the end result of the function is the return of an object

//if I want to generate objects and make sure that I'm using prototypes which I do most of the time I would rather use one of the other methods instead of a factory function and the reason for that is it's easier to implement the prototype

//if you're planning to use a prototype then you may not want to use a factory function

//a factory function is just a function that creates objects and returns them that'sa factory function is just a function that creates objects and returns them that's

//ADVANTAGES
//first it's simple it's just a function it's there's no setup there's no fuss it's just a function and it's it's really easy to read
//no duplicate code and our logic is isolated in one place
//have data privacy

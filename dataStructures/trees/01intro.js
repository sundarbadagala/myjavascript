//a tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges
//a tree is a non-linear data structure compared to arrays linked lists stacks and queues which are linear data structures
//in linear data structures the time required to search is proportional to the size of the data set
//more the data more the time needed to search
//trees however owing to the non-linear nature allow quicker and easier access to the data
// a tree will not contain any loops or cycles
//USAGE
//file systems for directory structure, a family tree, an organization tree or more relatable examples such as the dom, chat bots, abstract syntax trees etc

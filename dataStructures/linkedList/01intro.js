//a linked list is a linear data structure  that includes a series of connected nodes
//each node consists of a data value and a pointer that points to the next node
// the list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure
//random access of elements is not feasible and accessing an element has linear time complexity

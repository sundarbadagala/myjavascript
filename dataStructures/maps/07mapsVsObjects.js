//objects are unordered whereas maps are ordered
//keys in objects can only be string or symbol type whereas in maps they can be of any type
//an object has a prototype and may contain a few default keys which may collide with your own keys if you're not careful a map on the other hand does not contain any keys by default
//objects are not iterables whereas maps are iterables
//apart from storing data you can attach functionality to an object whereas maps are restricted to just storing data

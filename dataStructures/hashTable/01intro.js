//a hash table also known as hash map is a data structure that is used to store key value pairs
//given a key you can associate a value with that key for very fast lookup
//javascript's object is a special implementation of the hash table data structure.however, object class adds its own keys so keys that U input May conflict and override the inherited default properties
//Maps which were introduced in 2015 allow you to store key value pairs without the shortcomings of an object
//writing your own hash table implementation is a very popular JavaScript interview question

//usage
//hash tables are typically implemented where constant time lookup and insertion are required
//common examples are database indexing and caches
